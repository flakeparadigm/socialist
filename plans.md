# Application Concept
SociaList is a social "todo" list application. It allows users to subscribe to public lists as well as share things directly to other users' lists.

* Users can mark any entry as "complete"
* Users can view a list of all entries they have marked as "complete"

## Phase Three - Signup
* Users can create an account & password

## Phase Four - Friendship (MVP)
